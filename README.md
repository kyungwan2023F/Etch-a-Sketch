# Project Etch-a-Sketch
A project to create a grid of boxes on a page utilizing DOM manipulation. When mouse is inside the boxes the boxes will display
random colors and when the mouse is outside the color will disappear. The button on top, when clicked, will prompt user to input the 
number of squares he/she desires and change the dimensions of the grid based on the input.
